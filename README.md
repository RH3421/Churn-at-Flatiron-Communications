## Business Problem


## Data and Preparation



### Methods
Our dataset comes from an anonymous top 6 cellular provider and contains information on approximately 50,000 customers, collected through 2014. As stated previously, about half of churn is due to nonpayment, though our dataset only contains data of those who churned voluntarily. 
We used Scikit Learn as well as Sci-py to validate that our model. 


## Modeling

### Baseline Model



### Model 1



### Model 2




### Model 3





### Model 4


### Final Model




### Conclusions 

We identified the 3 most impactful predictors of churn from our analysis:

  1. Customers are 1.45x times as likely to churn for every day that they hold the same cell phone.
  2. Customers are 1.23x times as likely to churn for every additional subscriber added onto a plan.
  3. Customers are 1.16x times as likely to churn for every 1% increase in charges.

### Recommendations

Based on our analyses we recommend our stakeholder implement 3 targeted approaches to reduce churn:

  1. Offer discounted or complimentary cell phone upgrades for loyal customers to receive the latest devices. 
  2. Create  a loyalty program to reward multiple subscriber customers.
  3. Control customer charges by avoiding increasing fees on customers bills.
